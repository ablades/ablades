## ðŸ”­ What I'm working on:
 - [**Relevant for Reddit**](github.com/ablades/relevant) - This is my current passion project that I've been working on for quite awhile and I love it! The web app is meant to fill a niche in an era of information overload. You can think of it as a Google Alerts for Reddit. It utilizes Golang, React/Redux, Docker, MongoDB, Reddit API, Custom Data Structures, Concurrency and a plethora of more things. If you'd like to learn more about it, check out the github or my website!
    
 - [**Portofilo Website**](github.com/ablades/portfolio) - I've mentioned it a couple of times now but my website is the other main thing (outside of classes) getting my attention. It's built using React and some third party packages. I still have some content to fill in and I also have a few cool ideas that I've been slowly trying to develop. One of those ideas is extending some github functionality onto my website by having [realtime updates of my github streak seamlessesly appear as the background of my Projects Panel.](github.com/ablades/streaktaker) Stay tuned!
    
 - **Classes and Interview Prep!**
 
    
## ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning: 
  - **Rust, Programming Language** - I've decided to dive into the programming language Rust as part of my Capstone. I've wanted to expand my systems programming knowledge for awhile now since one of my hobbies is tinkering with things and I'd like to expand that to embeded devices and IoT. I chose Rust in part due to all the great things I've heard about it and the fact that it's a modern take on systems programming. So far I've had a blast learning about it.
  
  - **Go, Programming Language (Deeper Dive)** - I've been working with Golang for awhile now but I keep finding more and more to explore! Lately, I've been using Go to add concurrency to my project, Relevant to help with scale and speed for subreddit processing.
